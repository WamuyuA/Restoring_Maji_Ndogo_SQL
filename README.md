# Restoring_Maji_Ndogo_SQL
This project was developed as part of the ALX Data Analytics course to practically  apply and reinforce learning.

In this project, we dived into the the intricacies of using SQL to solve complex problems by offering less guidance as we progressed.

### **Project Overview**

The SQL learning included 4 summative assessments related to an integrated project on restoring the lifeblood of Maji Ndogo ( a fictious country in the project). 

The Maji Ndogo database contains 60,000 records collected by field surveyors employed for this project. The main task is to analyze the database records to investigate the relationship between access issues and rising crime rates in Maji Ndogo. 

The objective is to extract insights and propose recommendations that will help the Maji Ndogo engineers enhance water infrastructure and the communityâ€™s well-being.
